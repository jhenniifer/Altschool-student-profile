    <h2 >Biography</h2>
<p>
    I am Jennifer, a passionate learner and aspiring front-end developer. unlike others, I have not always been interest in technologies and websites. My interest in it sparked this year when i had a conversation with a mentor who has a career in the tech industry. I started my extensive research and landed in front-end. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online resources and i knew it is for me. I have not been able to create any large project but the little I have been about to bring to life warms my soul. Since i started my front-end journey, I have not been able to look at websites the same again. I look at them with appreciation and curiosity because i know now someone or some people put in work to get this done.When I'm not coding, I work as a social media manager and a big sister. I am also an introverted nerd who obsesses over anime. Balancing work and learning has been a challenge, but my determination to grow in tech keeps me motivated. I’ve learned to manage my time better and stay consistent with my studies. I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to making meaningful contributions in the tech space. I also hope to mentor others entering the tech field, sharing what I’ve learned along the way.

    <h2 >Why I Joined the AltSchool Program</h2>
<p>
    I get overwhemled and anxious pretty easily. I needed a program that take their time to teach the skill i want to learn and not stuff me with knowledge in a short perod of time.  In my search for a program, I came across Alt School. I found it on LinkedIn and i was impressed. a 12 month program, with an engaging community and scholarship opportunities, I just knew i found what i needed. I chose Alt School because of its practical, project-based learning environment and supportive community. The program aligns perfectly with my goal of becoming a skilled front-end developer I joined Alt School to build a strong foundation in front-end development and enhance my technical skills. I wanted a structured program that would challenge me. Alt School became the perfect platform because of its hands-on learning approach and supportive community.  I aim to become a proficient web developer capable of creating modern and responsive websites and i know this will be possible with AltSchool.
